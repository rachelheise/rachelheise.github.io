## Brief Overview

I am currently working as a Research Biostatistician I at Weill Cornell Medicine, and I've been at WCM for the past two years.  Before coming to Cornell, I completed my MS in Biostatistics at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health in 2022. Prior to graduate school, I worked as an engineer and received my BS in Industrial Engineering and ME in Engineering Management from Rochester Institute of Technology.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, yoga, and finding new books to read (both fiction and non-fiction). I also love exploring NYC and discovering great coffee shops!
